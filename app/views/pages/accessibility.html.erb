  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using this website</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The Register your Waste exemptions service is run by the Environment Agency.
    We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For
    example, that means you should be able to:
  </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
    <li>
      listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most
      recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">We have also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this website is</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>The focus of the page is being managed without user input. Once the ‘Skip to main content’ link has been actioned, the link remains active on subsequent pages for screen reader users. This removes the ability to control the focus and will place the user at the beginning of the each page.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if you cannot access parts of this website</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you need information on this website in large print or braille:</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The Environment Agency is committed to making its website accessible, in
    accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications)
    (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
    This service is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed.
    <p class="govuk-body">Non-accessible content</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Focus is being managed without user input [2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)]</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    There is an issue with some screen readers. Once the ‘Skip to main
    content’ link has been actioned, the link remains active on subsequent
    pages for screen reader users. This means that focus order is not how it
    was programmed, but the user can still navigate the site. [2018 regulations]
  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we tested this website</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">The service was last tested on 30th August 2024 and was checked for compliance with WCAG 2.2 AA.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    It was tested by DAC, and the
    non-compliant elements will be included in the ongoing development work.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This statement was prepared on 26th March 2025.</p>
