# Allows us to automatically generate the change log from the tags, issues,
# labels and pull requests on GitHub. Added as a dependency so all dev's have
# access to it to generate a log, and so they are using the same version.
# New dev's should first create GitHub personal app token and add it to their
# ~/.bash_profile (or equivalent)
# https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator#github-token
# Then simply run `bundle exec rake changelog` to update CHANGELOG.md
# Should be in the :development group however when it is it breaks deployment
# to Heroku. Hence moved outside group till we can understand why.
